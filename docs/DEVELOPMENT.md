# Development

## Run it locally

Requires Node 22.18+.

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.dev.vars` in the repo folder with throwaway local values (never your deployed secrets):

```bash
printf 'AUTH_SECRET=%s\nINTERNAL_SECRET=%s\nTWITCH_CLIENT_ID=local-dev-client-id\nTWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=local-dev-client-secret\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .dev.vars
```

On Windows, `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/configure-twitch.ps1` writes it for you. Then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open http://127.0.0.1:5173.
- `/overlay.html?demo=1&arena=1` shows the overlay with fake chatters.
- Twitch sign-in needs a real Twitch app and a public https site, so it only works once deployed.

## Tests

`npm run test:all` runs:

- the unit tests (`npm run test:unit` on its own),
- both builds and the workerd upload test,
- the browser tests,
- a local end-to-end duel against a `cf dev` it starts on port 5199 with its own state folder.

The end-to-end test signs EventSub webhooks with the `AUTH_SECRET` from `.dev.vars`. `MINI_PORT`
and `MINI_PERSIST` change the dev port and the local state folder.

### Live test

`npm run test:live` plays real duels through Twitch chat on a live deployment.

- It needs two Chromes with remote debugging, each signed in to Twitch and PixFray (`LIVE_A_CDP`,
  `LIVE_B_CDP`).
- It refuses to post while the channel (`LIVE_CHANNEL`) is live.
- It changes both accounts' ranks.

knight and ninja sprites.
